to build the project both tcpclient and tcpserverwithselect need to be built. this will create the executables for both in the x64 file and then the debug or release
depending on what they are build in. 

running the project you can do from command line. both exe files for the tcpclient and tcpserverwithselect need to be executed (tcpserverwithselect first before tcpclient)
and you can run multiple tcpclients 

it prompts clients to send a chat message and if you type "#leave" you will disconnect from the server.
